Review how the tres are created. I remember that a Resource file has to be created to begin with
Then need to edit it. When I am creating it as resource, unable to recollect how it was done

There is a gd script with class_name ClassName and that extendes Resource. 
There are attr to this ClassName, which can contain other objects. 

Then we can create a new resource in Godot and select the created ClassName, and the save it as tres.
After that, double clicking opens the resource directly in the UI only.  

The class for grid_tileset.tres is not available
